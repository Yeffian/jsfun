Some fun things with JavaScript

Some fun things I am playing with. This code displays Python online for easy reference:

It needs to be a Python file to display properly.
Simply use ?url= and the url you want to display.

For shorter code you can use a reordering quiz

Simply use ?url= and the url you want to display.
